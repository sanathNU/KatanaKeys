This is a small scale project for a typing website, where users can try their typing test. 
Planning to do as a 3 phase project. Should start working on the architecture of this.

## Introduction
The main goal of this website, it to give an interactive typing website with random quotes that are uncensored by any goal with the intent of typing a paragraph of any topic of choice.

## Architecture
Planned to be developed in 3 phases

### Phase 1
* Simple typing website with a fixed number of quotes.
* Connect python to the javascript to get more number of quotes that can be accessed dynamically.
* Use python API to get more data from quote websites.

### Phase 2
* Develop analysis of the data of wpm done by the users and present it as a graph. Or a time series
* Run a linear regression model on then number of words vs speed and accuracy graph.
* Add a safe filter for texts, which can be vulgur and add a sign that warns

### Phase 3
* Create an option for genres of different types of quotes.
* Scrap from everything. Create an LLM model that spits out good stuff depending on the user's workablility.
